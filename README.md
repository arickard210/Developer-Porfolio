Porfolio for Alex Rickard

# Description of Repository
Several portfolio projects are saved in this repository. Three emails that I cloned from emails that I have received in my personal inbox. These emails show a professional touch and my inspiration to continue to build good looking HTML.
I have also included two landing pages that I created. One clone was designed off of CodeCademy's Colmar Academy. The Burger landing page was built from a design document my collegue created as a project for their portfolio in UX/UI design.
